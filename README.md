## 2 Introduction: Mapping the Early Modern Inns of Court
The early modern Inns of Court have long been recognised as an intellectual and cultural hub. ‘Mapping the Early Modern Inns of Court’ is an initiative that brings together an international community of researchers from a variety of disciplines working in this field. They run seminars, a blog, and provide a platform where researchers can share their work and bring published material to everyone’s attention. 
<br><br>
This exhibition highlights some of the areas that the group has explored in their seminars and publications: recreation (fencing, revelling, and gaming); literary culture at the Inns; religion and preaching; learning the law and verbal skills; travel and exploration endeavours. 
<br><br>
The text in the caption cards includes submissions from some of the people involved in the project: Blessin Adams, Penelope Geng, Jackie Watson, and Jessica Winston. Contributions have also been made by Wilfrid Prest and Sylvia Sumira. 
<br><br>
A collection of essays produced by the project, Mapping the Early Modern Inns of Court, is forthcoming from Palgrave. For more information and to sign up for the mailing list see: https://mappinginns.wordpress.com/

## 3 Recreation  
Innsmen enjoyed a variety of leisurely pursuits while at the Inns of Court, including dancing, fencing, gambling, and music. Revelling was also popular amongst Innsmena, as playgoers, performers and as authors of plays. 
<br><br>
The Misfortunes of Arthur is a play “written in 1587 by Thomas Hughes, and other law students at Gray’s Inns, for performance before the Queen at Greenwich. In that venue, the Innsmen presented a prologue calling attention to their background and identity as law students, and thereby constructing for the queen an image of themselves as legal professionals: they are men whose legal training and serious dispositions make them central to the governance of the country”. – Jessica Winston
<br><br>
“Cultural, literary, and intellectual forms of play elevated Inns' members, while lower, disorderly forms debased them. Yet these modes of play were not wholly distinctive, nor mutually exclusive. Revels and high drama went hand-in-hand with feasting, drinking, and gaming … Rude, base, and at times libellous play was deliberately used by a group of serious-minded law students to develop auxiliary skills such as rhetoric, invention, and argument; to explore legal ethics and a broader kind of jurisprudence; and to put into practice humanist and medical methods of restorative play.” – Blessin Adams

Sir John Davies (1569-1626) was a poet and member of Middle Temple. He fell drunk during the Middle Temple’s 1597/1598 Christmas revels, spoke insultingly of women, and had to be carried back to the Inn after falling asleep in a stall. This was allowed to happen despite the Inn’s proclamation that the feast of Christmas was meant to be celebrated solemnly. A few days later, Davies “practised factiously against the Prince of Love [i.e. Richard Martin], and earnestly stirred enmity betwixt him” and the members of Lincoln’s Inn. In the aftermath of the revels, he attacked Martin with a ‘bastionado’ while the latter was at dinner in Hall. He escaped by boat to Oxford, and was expelled and disbarred in absentia shortly after.”  – Jackie Watson
<br><br>
A bastionado is a cane used to administer a blow, and originated from Turkey, where it was reserved for beating someone on the soles of the feet. It is not known whether Davies focused only on Davies’s feet …

## 5 Portrait of Richard Martin (1570-1618) MT/19/POR/464   
Richard Martin had been elected as the ‘Prince d’amour/Prince of Love’ for the 1597/1598 Middle Temple revels, which involved overseeing the participants’ skills in dancing, singing, and music. The performers (all members of the Inn) also had to demonstrate their skills in rhetoric and law. Martin was one of a group of wits that included Ben Jonson and John Donne (Lincoln’s Inn), and may have been one of the co-authors of the ‘Parliament Fart,’ an immensely popular poetic libel circulated in manuscript from 1607 onwards. “The poem’s characteristics of wit and parody invite comparison with the law sports of the Inns of Court Christmas revels; in both cases, parody relies on a heightened awareness of the codes and conventions that define an institution.” (Early Stuart Libels: https://www.earlystuartlibels.net/htdocs/parliament_fart_section/C0.html)
