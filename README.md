## Introduction: Mapping the Early Modern Inns of Court
The early modern Inns of Court have long been recognised as an intellectual and cultural hub. ‘Mapping the Early Modern Inns of Court’ is an initiative that brings together an international community of researchers from a variety of disciplines working in this field. They run seminars, a blog, and provide a platform where researchers can share their work and bring published material to everyone’s attention. 
<br><br>
This exhibition highlights some of the areas that the group has explored in their seminars and publications: recreation (fencing, revelling, and gaming); literary culture at the Inns; religion and preaching; learning the law and verbal skills; travel and exploration endeavours. 
<br><br>
The text in the caption cards includes submissions from some of the people involved in the project: Blessin Adams, Penelope Geng, Jackie Watson, and Jessica Winston. Contributions have also been made by Wilfrid Prest and Sylvia Sumira.

A collection of essays produced by the project, Mapping the Early Modern Inns of Court, is forthcoming from Palgrave. For more information and to sign up for the mailing list see: https://mappinginns.wordpress.com/
